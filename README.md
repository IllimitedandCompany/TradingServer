Here is a summary of what the code does:

The function getLink() takes a combination (a string that will be appended to the base URL) as input.
The base URL is defined as "https://bit.ly/".
The attempts counter is increased by 1.
The full URL is constructed by concatenating the base URL and the combination.
The code then tries to make a GET request to the constructed URL using the axios library with a timeout of 10 seconds.
If the request is successful, the suc counter is increased by 1, the redirected URL is logged, and the addtodb() function is called with the original URL and the redirected URL as arguments.
The waitTimeInSeconds variable is reset to 360 seconds (6 minutes) to wait for the next request.
If the request encounters a 429 error (too many requests), the tooManyRequestsCount counter is increased by 1 and the code waits for waitTimeInSeconds seconds before retrying the request.
The waitTimeInSeconds variable is doubled for the next retry attempt.
If the request fails for any other reason, the erri counter is increased by 1 and an error message is logged.
Overall, the link checker part of this repo works as a script for making GET requests to URLs and logging the responses, while handling errors such as 429 errors (too many requests) and network errors.

Detailed Explanation:

The code is an async function called getLink that takes a combination parameter. The purpose of this function is to send an HTTP request to a URL constructed by appending combination to a base URL of "https://bit.ly/". The function uses the axios library to make the HTTP request, which is an asynchronous operation.

Before making the request, the function increments a variable called attempts to keep track of how many attempts have been made to fetch a link. It also initializes a few other variables, such as bytesReceived, tooManyRequestsCount, and waitTimeInSeconds.

Once the request is made, the function attaches event listeners to the response data stream. The 'data' event is used to track how many bytes of data have been received in the response, and to set the waitTimeInSeconds variable to 360,000 milliseconds (6 minutes) whenever new data is received. The function also resets the tooManyRequestsCount variable to 0 whenever new data is received.

If the response data contains a redirect URL, the function checks if the URL starts with "https://bit.ly" and if it does not, it increments a variable called suc and calls an asynchronous function called addtodb to add the link to a database. The function then sends three separate messages to a message broker using asynchronous pushMSG function calls. The first message reports the current link being processed, the second message reports the total number of successful links added to the database, and the third message reports some tracking information about the current state of the function.

If the response data contains a "404 Not Found" error, the function increments a variable called erri. If the response data also contains a redirect URL, the function checks if the URL starts with "https://bit.ly". If it does, the function increments a variable called FalsePositives. If it does not start with "https://bit.ly", the function increments a variable called Dsuc and calls an asynchronous function called addDtodb to add the dangerous link to a database. The function then sends a message to the message broker reporting the number of dangerous links added to the database.

If the response data contains a "403 Forbidden" error, the function increments a variable called Forbiddens and calls the addtodb function to add the link to a database.

If the HTTP request fails for any other reason, the function increments the erri variable and sends a message to the message broker reporting the error.

The getLink function is an example of how to use asynchronous functions and event listeners to handle HTTP requests and responses. It also demonstrates how to use message brokers to communicate the status of the function to other parts of a larger system.
