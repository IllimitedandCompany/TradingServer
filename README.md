Proper walkthrough is not a priority for me, so for the moment I'll explain it simply.. but before I'll leave you with this gem: 

"Isnt it good when you want to do something, and you actually have to dive and to learn into the subject to get it to work?" =)
If its something you really want, well, have at it you'll at the bare minimum learn. =D

Simple Explanation:
MetaApiCloud account, use broker MT5 account(MT4 deployments currently down(09/02/24)), read the scripts functions before using, check for defined intervals, fill in the variables including database(MongoDB Atlas) and have fun.. Pro Tip: check the webhook variables, or you might open a sell with a buy(or the reverse) when you get there.. x)
(Extra) Due to current state of the api: deploy account first, remove or condition the !account part once account is deployed.

Proper walkthrough will take some time, I have other priorities right now.

Good Luck to those who adventure,
